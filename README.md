# Crypto Market 

This is a personal project that helped me improve my coding skills by building a realistic project. 



### The project

Users should be able to:

- Search cryptocurrencies and see the info;
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page;
- See some of the most popular cryptocurrencies;
- Error message to coins thar don't exist in the API.
